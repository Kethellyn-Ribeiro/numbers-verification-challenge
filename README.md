# Numbers verification Challenge

This Python script prompts the user to input a number and then evaluates it based on several conditions. The script determines:

- Whether the number is positive, negative, or zero;
- Whether the number is even or odd;
- Whether the number is divisible by 3.
  
# How It Works

The user is asked to input a number.
The script evaluates the number and stores the results in a list.
The results are then printed as a single formatted output.
